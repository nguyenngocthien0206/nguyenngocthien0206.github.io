# About me

My fullname is Nguyen Ngoc Thien, currently a Data Platform Engineer at Got It Vietnam. My programming journey began in the latter half of 2021 when I was introduced to the basics of C through an engineering course. Prior to that, I had a surface-level understanding of Python from self-learning. During that time, I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process and the systematic approach that came with writing code and using its surrounding technologies. I immediately jumped into the deep end by learning Vim as my text editor. It was after that course that I decided to pursue Software Engineering.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games—especially LOL—and I also love exercising through activities such as footbal, yoga and pool. My passion for learning is evident in my various programming ventures.
